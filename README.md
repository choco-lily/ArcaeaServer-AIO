# Have you ever thought of a fork's fork?
All-in-one package repo. A fork of AriArcaeaServer, which is a fork of Lost's Arcaea-Server.
 
# This repo has:
- Database pre-installed (6.0 song support)
- My previous tool installed (Linkplay bot)
- Most of maps made & set (Some BYD, Breached Maps missing)
- Keep in note! the "env" files needs to be renamed to ".env" to work properly. Using a Mac is a nightmare ðŸ”¥
